# Chatbot-Sentiment-Analysis
This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer legal FAQs using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning. It leverages a dataset (intents.json) that contains predefined legal questions categorized under various topics such as Contracts, Property Law, and Criminal Law. The chatbot is trained using the train.py script, which processes the text, tokenizes user inputs, and builds a Neural Network model using PyTorch. The training process employs a bag-of-words approach to understand and categorize user queries effectively. Once trained, the chatbot can be tested and used via the test.py script, where it predicts the most relevant response based on the userâ€™s input. While sentiment analysis is not explicitly integrated into this project, it can be added to enhance user interaction by detecting emotions and adjusting responses accordingly. This chatbot aims to provide quick and relevant legal information, making it a useful tool for individuals seeking basic legal guidance.
